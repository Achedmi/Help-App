# helpapp

A new Flutter project.

# App Idea 💡:

### The idea of this app is to make donations more easier and can be done by anyone anytime and anywhere and specially for the right charities :

That could be done just by searching for a charity name on the search bar, or searching on Categories, or choosing the random Feature if you want to donate randomly to a random charity.

To be able to donate to any charity you Should have already got some wallet’s balence 💵.

after selecting your preferred charity you can see it’s achievements as well as people reviews and ratings, if you are satisfied, click donate and insert the amount of the donation with a little support message and you can chose if you want to make you donation public (display your name ...) or unknown, then send .🎉 congrats you just help someone 🎉.

at the end of the month or the year (or whatever it take the charity to achieve an achievement) you will receive an email or notification about the achievement of charity that you have donated to, and what your money has changed 😇 (that will be possible just if you make a public donation)

**NOT ANY CHARITY COULD BE IN THE APP !** the charities that will be displayed on the app will be certified and trusted by the App manager or someone responsible for this position to make sure that every donation went to the right place
