# App Idea 💡:

### The goal of this app is to make donating easier, accessible to anyone, anytime, and anywhere, with a focus on supporting the right charities.

You can donate by simply searching for a charity name using the search bar, browsing through categories, or using the **Random Feature** to donate to a randomly selected charity.

To make a donation, you need to ensure your wallet has sufficient balance 💵.

After selecting your preferred charity, you can view its achievements, along with reviews and ratings from other donors. If you're satisfied, click **Donate**, specify the amount you'd like to give, and include a support message. You can also choose to make your donation public (showing your name) or anonymous. 🎉 Congratulations, you’ve just helped someone! 🎉

At the end of the month, year, or when the charity reaches a milestone, you will receive an email or notification detailing the impact of your donation and the charity’s achievements 😇 (This will only be available if you choose to make your donation public).

**Important:** Only verified and certified charities will be featured in the app. A designated app manager will ensure that all donations are directed to legitimate causes.

# Technologies ⚙:

### flutter_bloc:

This is my first time working with this state management package. It was challenging at first, but I'm getting the hang of it as a new "provider package" user (so far, I've only used Cubits).

### animate_do:

I used this package to create some fade-in animations.

- If you find any "dumb" code in the app, don’t worry, it’s just me being inexperienced. Feel free to point it out, and I’ll gladly appreciate the feedback 😊—I’m just learning 🤷‍♂️.
